# Space Shooter 3D

This project is my personal game project about space shooter game. 
Im doing this project as my learning activity for programming in c#. 
The most difficult part that I learnt from this project was implementing the laser in player, but it was worth the time as it turned out. 
Personally, I think Line renderer is quite tricky to be implemented, 
as we need quite precise position and raycasting the object in order for it to work, as well as to turn the light on and off.
